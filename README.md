# QuickScript
This project was created for HopHacks held in John Hopkins University in Spring 2017 by a group of four people, including me. 
We won Rookie Hackers Awards as three of the four in the groups were first time hackers and we managed to create this system.
About 50% of the prescribed pills are either never filled or not taken as prescribed.
We created a system that would send out text message alerts to geriatric paitents, reminding them to take their pills. 
Users will have to answer back with Y-took the pill, N-did not take the pill or S-Snooze for an hour.
This will give the doctors and nurses a snapshot of how and if their paitents are taking drugs as prescibed.
If the users have not been answering the message or keeps sending No, their doctors and emergency contacts will automatically be notified.

The backend was created with Python Flask.
