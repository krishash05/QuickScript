# QuickScript
About 50% of the prescribed pills are either never filled or not taken as prescribed.
We created a system that would send out text message alerts to geriatric patients, reminding them to take their pills. 
Users will have to answer back with Y-took the pill, N-did not take the pill or S-Snooze for an hour.
This will give the doctors and nurses a snapshot of how and if their patients are taking drugs as prescribed.
If the users have not been answering the message or keep sending No, their doctors and emergency contacts will automatically be notified.
